watch videos together, in sync ;)  
create a room, invite a friend with the room-id, and that's it!  
enjoy a buffer-free watch-together session, completely in sync.  

_so what's the catch?_ you both need the video files locally :')   
well you can download a large file when you have wifi and then watch it together on mobile data or on not so good network connections. [webRTC](https://webrtc.org/) handles it all! no more screen sharing, no more streaming, no more exhausting daily data limits.

#### highlights:
- support for subtitles (for you weebs and k-drama fans)
- a chatbox to share live reactions
- astronaut illustrations while you wait for your friend to join

#### dependencies:
- svelte: the main compiler
- vite: the build tool
- firebase: webRTC signalling server using firestore
